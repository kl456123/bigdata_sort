# bigdata_sort

* I do this work just for showing my teacher my ability .I can do any thing as long as I want. 

* It is just a project for sorting big data.

## key points:

- quicksort in every subfiles

- mergesort all the files into the one

## others

* you also should know how to tackle the bottleneck of the running time,like exchanging
files between memory and disk and so on.

## TODO

- multiple processes or threads

- make code more robust and flexible
